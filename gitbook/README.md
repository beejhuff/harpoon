# Introduction

_Lowcal_ is essentially a wrapper around a set of
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) configurations that
make it easy to run a local/offline development environment for Docker.
It's an ideal choice for those that don't wish to run a full container
management or orchestration platform on their workstation. _Lowcal_ has
been tested with [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) and
[Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) on
MacOS.

## Requirements

* Bash (`bash`)
* Make (`make`)
* Docker (`docker`)
* Docker Compose (`docker-compose`)
