# Task Plugins

## "Wrapped Container" Tasks

If you'd like to run a Docker container as a _Harpoon_ task:

1. Add the following `LABEL`s to the `Dockerfile` for your image:

  ```dockerfile
  LABEL harpoon_name=mytask
  LABEL harpoon_type=task
  LABEL harpoon_args="<arg...>"
  LABEL harpoon_description="My task does this and that"
  ```

2. Build, tag, and push your plugin to any Docker registry.

  ```bash
  docker build -t mytask .
  docker tag mytask <repository>/mytask
  docker push <repository>/mytask
  ```

3. Install your plugin.

  ```bash
  harpoon plug:in <repository>/mytask
  ```

This task's commands can now be run with `harpoon mytask <arg...>`. Try
`harpoon mytask:help` üòÅ

## Helper Tasks

You can provide your own custom tasks and use them with _Harpoon_. For a
simple example, check out the `http` task's
[`handler.sh`](../../../tasks/http/handler.sh) and
[`bootstrap.sh`](../../../tasks/http/bootstrap.sh). Note the use of the
`## [<arg>...] %% Your description` comment convention. _Harpoon_ will
use this to automatically add your custom tasks to the `help` output.

1. Create directory for your _task_ project, or add to an existing
   project.
2. Inside your project directory, create a directory named
   `harpoon-plugin`.
3. In the `harpoon-plugin` directory:

   1. Create a file named `handler.sh`. _Harpoon_ will use this to
      handle all commands/sub-commands for your task.

   2. (Optional) Create a file named `bootstrap.sh`. _Harpoon_ will use
      this to load any custom environment variables you'd like to set
      and share with other tasks.

   3. Create a `Dockerfile` (or add to one that already exists) with
      metadata for _Harpoon_ to use during installation.

      ```dockerfile
      FROM scratch
      
      COPY harpoon-plugin /harpoon-plugin
      
      LABEL harpoon_name=mytask
      LABEL harpoon_type=task
      LABEL harpoon_dir=/harpoon-plugin
      ```

   4. Build, tag, and push your plugin to any Docker registry.

      ```bash
      docker build -t mytask .
      docker tag mytask <repository>/mytask
      docker push <repository>/mytask
      ```

4. Install your plugin.

   ```bash
   harpoon plug:in <repository>/mytask
   ```

This task's commands can now be run with `harpoon mytask:*`. Try
`harpoon mytask:help` üòÅ
