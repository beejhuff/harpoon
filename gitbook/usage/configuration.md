# Configuration

## Environment Variables

_Lowcal_ uses environment variables exclusively for all configuration
parameters, many of which are passed directly to the underlying
containers.

For details, explore the [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) at
the root of this repository, and the `.yml` files for each included
service in `services/*`.

## Custom Domain

You can configure _Lowcal_ to use your own domain:

```bash
export CUSTOM_DOMAIN="example.com"
```

If you would like to use HTTPS, you may choose _one_ of the following
options:

### HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

_Internet connection required_

Example configuration:

```bash
export TRAEFIK_ACME=true
#export TRAEFIK_ACME_STAGING=true
export TRAEFIK_ACME_LOGGING=true
export TRAEFIK_ACME_DNSPROVIDER=route53
export TRAEFIK_ACME_EMAIL=you@example.com
export TRAEFIK_ACME_ONDEMAND=false
export TRAEFIK_ACME_ONHOSTRULE=true

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

Refer to
[Traefik's documentation](https://docs.traefik.io/toml/#acme-lets-encrypt-configuration)
for more information.

### HTTPS with static (or self-signed) certificates

_Works offline_

1. Copy your certificate and key files to `core/traefik/certs`.
2. Set the following environment variables, replacing the values with
   the appropriate file names:

   ```bash
   export TRAEFIK_TLS_CERTFILE=example.crt
   export TRAEFIK_TLS_KEYFILE=example.key
   ```

## Docker Compose Projects

If your project uses `docker-compose`, here's an example
`docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    environment:
      - TERM=xterm
    labels:
      - "traefik.backend=app"
      - "traefik.port=9000"
      - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:app.example.com"
      - "traefik.frontend.entryPoints=http" # add ',https' for HTTPS support
      - "traefik.docker.network=lowcal"
      - "traefik.tags=lowcal"
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app

networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: lowcal
```

1. You'll need to specify all the `traefik.*` labels for your web
   service, customizing the `backend`, `port`, and `frontend` labels
   accordingly.
2. Then copy/paste the `networks` block to the bottom of your
   `docker-compose.yml`.
